								<p>During my occasional bouts of extended programming sessions, I&#39;d been having some issues with pains in my wrist. Nothing major but it tended to
									be rather annoying when it happened. I eventually decided to try getting a more ergonomic setup at my desk to see if it would make any noticeable
									difference.</p>
								<p>After doing some research online (is there any other place that you do research now a days?), I stumbled upon a bunch of information about split
									keyboards. Their major benefit being that you can position the 2 halves separately including tilting them so that you don&#39;t have to angle your
									wrists so much. This sounded promising to me, so I began investigating what some of the most popular split keyboards were available.</p>
								<!--more-->

								<p>One of the ones that popped up was the <a href="https://www.ergodox.io/">Ergodox</a> which seemed to have some uniqueness in that it was an open
									source DIY keyboard. Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t in the mood to build my own keyboard from scratch.</p>
								<p>Another cool keyboard that caught my eye was the <a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/">Keyboardio Model 01</a> which looked very awesome with its
									wooden frame and unique thumb cluster.</p>
								<p>Both these keyboards were using vertically staggered key arrangements though, which I didn&#39;t know if I would like. Also they seemed like they
									would take an absolute age to ship. So a quick search of amazon found a couple of promising options that I could get in only 2 days!</p>
								<p>Some other noteworthy split keyboards that came up were <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Freestyle-Split-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B06XSPGL9S/">Kinesis
										Freestyle Edge</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Koolertron-Programmable-Mechanical-Keyboard-Ergonomic/dp/B076LH4PY2">Koolertron</a> these
									looked much more familiar with their regular qwerty style layout.</p>
								<p>I actually ended up ordering the Koolertron as I thought it looked more interesting.</p>
								<p>The first thing I noticed upon trying to actually use a split keyboard was that I had never learned to properly touch type. You don&#39;t really
									notice this sort of thing until you attempt to type the letter &#39;B&#39; with the wrong hand and your finger just hits thin air. &quot;Wha??.. Oh
									yeah its on the other half of the keyboard, oops&quot;. My typing style at the time was some odd combination of 4 fingers on each hand floating over
									the keyboard at random, with occasional/often glances down at the letters to re-orient myself. It was after a few days of the frustration of not being
									able to type at all, that I knew it was time for me to learn to touch type correctly.</p>
								<p>At this point I knew I had a choice to make. I could just go ahead and learn to type correctly on a standard qwerty keyboard (or possibly a split
									qwerty), or I could take a look at something different entirely.</p>
								<p>I think most of us have heard the theories about how the qwerty layout was designed to slow down typists so that ye olde typewriter arms
									wouldn&#39;t jam, and therefore is a terrible layout for modern computers. I don&#39;t really know if that is true, but if I was going to have to
									learn to type from scratch anyway, why not look around and see what options were out there?</p>
								<p>Having known about the dvorak layout already, I wasn&#39;t really keen to learn something that looked so crazy. But after a quick search turned up
									many more layouts, I was intrigued.</p>
								<p>The main one that caught my eye was <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a>. It&#39;s biggest draw for me was that it kept my ctrl + z, x, c, and
									v, all in the same place. This was great since I used those a lot in coding (Copy and paste for the win!).</p>
								<p>So after a lot of consideration and concern I decided that if I really was going to try for more ergonomics, I should do the thing properly and go
									all in.</p>
								<p>This was when I decided to go and learn Colemak on a split vertically staggered keyboard.</p>
								<p>I bought an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox-EZ</a> and began to teach myself Colemak using <a href="https://www.keybr.com">keybr.com</a></p>
