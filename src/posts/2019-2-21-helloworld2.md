Hello World this is a different post which I am using as a placeholder while I iterate on my site design.

At some point I plan to call it "done" and then I'll start adding some real content. I'm thinking that I'll start with a post about how I actually made it, including some source code snippets and other musings.

## Todo list
- Finish site
- Write a post about the ins and outs of using metalsmith.io
- ~~Forget to write any other blog entries for several months~~
- Write about coding all my other side projects
- Upload some content to youtube
- Also github
- Do some more fun unity game projects
- And I guess actually blog about them
